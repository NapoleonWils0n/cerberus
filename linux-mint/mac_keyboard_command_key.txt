In Macs, instead of <Control>+c to copy and <Control>+c to paste, it's <Super>+c and <Super+v>, etc. 

1.) In your menu(mintMenu if you use Mint), select Keyboard. This will bring up the keyboard preferences.
2.) Go to the Layouts tab and click the Options button. This will now bring up a window with a list of options.
3.) Click on 'Alt/Win key behavior' and select 'Control is mapped to Win keys (and the usual Ctrl keys)'.
4.) Close that window, and in the Keyboard Preferences window, click 'Apply System-Wide'. Once you have done that, you can close Keyboard Preferences.


Now the Mac/Win(Super) key should act like the Control key, meaning that you can now copy/paste text using <Super>+c and <Super>+v, among any other hotkeys that use the Control key. The control key also still holds the same functionality as it did before
