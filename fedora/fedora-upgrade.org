** remove old kernels

After you boot into the latest kernel and test the system you can remove previous kernels. Old kernels remain even after dnf autoremove to avoid unintentional removals.

One of the easier ways to remove old kernels is with a script that retains the latest kernel. The script below works whenever Fedora updates a kernel, and does not depend upon a system upgrade.

#+begin_src bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

old_kernels=($(dnf repoquery --installonly --latest-limit=-1 -q))
if [ "${#old_kernels[@]}" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No old kernels found"
    exit 0
fi

if ! dnf remove "${old_kernels[@]}"; then
    echo "Failed to remove old kernels"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Removed old kernels"
exit 0
#+end_src
