* awk tab to comma

#+begin_src awk
awk 'BEGIN { FS="\t"; OFS="," } {
  rebuilt=0
  for(i=1; i<=NF; ++i) {
    if ($i ~ /,/ && $i !~ /^".*"$/) { 
      gsub("\"", "\"\"", $i)
      $i = "\"" $i "\""
      rebuilt=1 
    }
  }
  if (!rebuilt) { $1=$1 }
  print
}' input.tsv > output.csv
#+end_src


$i ~ /[,"]/ && $i !~ /^".*"$/ detects any field that contains , and/or " and isn't already enclosed in double quotes

gsub("\"", "\"\"", $i) escapes embedded " chars. by doubling them

$i = "\"" $i "\"" updates the result by enclosing it in double quotes

As stated before, updating any field causes awk to rebuild the line from the fields with the OFS value, i.e., , in this case, which amounts to the effective TSV -> CSV conversion; flag rebuilt is used to ensure that each input record is rebuilt at least once.
