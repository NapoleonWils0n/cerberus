List by speed

Take full advantage of using the fastest local mirror, which can be determined via the included Bash script, /usr/bin/rankmirrors.

Back up the existing /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist:

# cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup

Edit /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup and uncomment mirrors for testing with rankmirrors.

Optionally run the following sed line to uncomment every mirror:

# sed -i 's/^#Server/Server/' /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup

Finally, rank the mirrors. Operand -n 6 means only output the 6 fastest mirrors:

# rankmirrors -n 6 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

reload the mirrors
# pacman -Syy
