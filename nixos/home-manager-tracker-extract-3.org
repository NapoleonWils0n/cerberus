#+STARTUP: showall
* home-manager tracker extract 3

home manager can fail when you run home-manager switch
with an error saying it couldnt stop the tracker-extract-3.service

the tracker-extract-3.service is used by gnome search to index files

you can disable the tracker-extract-3.service by running the following command

#+begin_src sh
systemctl --user mask tracker-extract-3.service
#+end_src

reboot and then run 

#+begin_src sh
home-manager switch
#+end_src

and home manager should no longer show and error
