* destroy jail

Destroying a jail is not as simple as stopping the jail using service(8) and removing the jail directory and /etc/jail.conf entry.

FreeBSD takes system security very seriously. For this reason there are certain files that not even the root user can delete. This functionality is known as File Flags.

The first step is to stop the desired jail executing the following command:

#+begin_src sh
sudo service jail stop ubuntu
#+end_src

The second step is to remove these flags with chflags(1) by executing the following command, in which classic is the name of the jail to remove:

#+begin_src sh
sudo chflags -R 0 /usr/local/jails/linux/ubuntu
#+end_src

The third step is to delete the directory where the jail was:

#+begin_src sh
sudo rm -rxv /usr/local/jails/linux/ubuntu
#+end_src

Finally, it will be necessary to remove the jail entry in /etc/jail.conf or in jail.conf.d.
