** query

pkg query '%Ok : %Ov' ffmpeg

** rquery

#+begin_src sh
pkg rquery '%Ok : %Ov' ffmpeg
#+end_src

That will tell you what options were set on the installed package (pkg-query(8)) and the remote package (pkg-rquery(8)). The cached catalog has to be up to date (pkg-update(8)) but that usually happens automatically anyway.

** diff query rquery 

#+begin_src sh
diff <(pkg query '%Ok : %Ov' ffmpeg) <(pkg rquery '%Ok : %Ov' ffmpeg) > diff.txt
#+end_src
