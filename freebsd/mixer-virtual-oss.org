#+STARTUP: showall
* mixer and virtual oss

Suppose virtual_oss(8) is running with /dev/vdsp.ctl as its control
device, and pcm1 as the playback device.

Change the default device to pcm3,
and hot-swap to it for playback in virtual_oss(8):

#+begin_src sh
mixer -d pcm3 -V /dev/vdsp.ctl:play
#+end_src
