Mount the efi partition, it's probably already in fstab and getting mounted on /boot/efi. But if you have multiple disks you will have to mount each individual disk separately.

Do this on the running system, preferably before or right after the zpool upgrade command to upgrade the pools. Or update the boot code right after an update/upgrade of the OS.

#+begin_src sh
cp /boot/loader.efi /boot/efi/efi/freebsd/loader.efi
cp /boot/loader.efi /boot/efi/efi/boot/bootx64.efi
#+end_src
