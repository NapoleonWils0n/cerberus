--download-archive archive.txt: This is the magic flag.

It records every video ID you've already downloaded in a text file. If the ID is in the file, yt-dlp skips it.

Automation: Add this command to a Cron job or a systemd timer to run once an hour.

It will only download the "new" videos since the last run.
