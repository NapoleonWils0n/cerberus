* convert a macos installer to a iso file

In this particular walkthrough, we’ll be converting a MacOS Monterey installer application into an ISO file. You can use the same steps to create an ISO file from practically any other MacOS Installer with createinstallmedia present however, simply by replacing the file names where appropriate.

** How to Create a MacOS Monterey ISO File from an Installer

This process will take an installer for macOS and create an ISO file from it which can be booted or used as a typical disk image file. 

First, download MacOS Monterey installer from the Mac App Store
When the “Install MacOS Monterey.app” application is fully downloaded and within the /Applications folder, proceed

Next, open the Terminal application

** Create a disk image DMG file buy issuing the following command:

#+begin_src sh
hdiutil create -o Monterey -size 16g -volname Monterey -layout SPUD -fs HFS+J
#+end_src

** Mount the created DMG disk image as follows:

#+begin_src sh
hdiutil attach Monterey.dmg -noverify -mountpoint /Volumes/Monterey
#+end_src

** createinstallmedia

Next we will use createinstallmedia to create the macOS installer application on the mounted volume:

#+begin_src sh
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Monterey --nointeraction
#+end_src

** unmount volume

When createinstallmedia has finished, next you can unmount the volume you just created:

#+begin_src sh
hdiutil detach /volumes/Install\ macOS\ Monterey
#+end_src

** convert the dmg

Now we convert the DMG disk image file to an ISO disk image file (technically a CDR file but it’s the same as an iso)

#+begin_src sh
hdiutil convert Monterey.dmg -format UDTO -o Monterey.cdr
#+end_src

** rename the cdr file to iso

Finally, we rename the CDR file extension to ISO to convert the CDR to ISO:

#+begin_src sh
mv Monterey.cdr Monterey.iso
#+end_src
