#+end_src

can you create a flake.nix for python313Packages.openai-whisper
with the override for cuda


#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = "x86_64-linux"; }; # Replace with your system
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = [
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.override {
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        })
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

Key changes and explanations:

-   *=inputs.nixpkgs.url=*:  Specifies the nixpkgs repository to use.  Using =nixos-unstable= is common for up-to-date packages.  Change if needed.
-   *=system = "x86_64-linux"=*:  Important to specify your system architecture. Adjust if you're not on x86\_64-linux.
-   *=pkgs = import nixpkgs { ... }=*: Imports nixpkgs, making its packages available.
-   *=devShells.default=*: Defines the development shell.
-   The =buildInputs= are identical to your working =shell.nix=.
-   Uses =pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;= for clarity.


*** in using nixos 25.05 is it ok to use unstable in the flake.nix


Using =nixos-unstable= with NixOS 25.05 is generally acceptable, but be aware:

-   *Potential for Breakage:* Unstable can introduce breaking changes, requiring adjustments to your flake.
-   *Package Versions:* You'll likely get newer package versions than those in NixOS 25.05.  This can be desirable for features or bug fixes, but also a source of incompatibility.
-   *Not Reproducible Across Time:* Pinning nixpkgs to a specific commit hash makes your builds truly reproducible. Unstable changes daily.

If stability and reproducibility are paramount, use the nixpkgs corresponding to your NixOS release (e.g., =nixos-25.05=). Otherwise, =nixos-unstable= is fine for development and when you want the latest packages. Weigh the pros and cons based on your project's requirements.


*** i dont want daily changes otherwise it will rebuild too much

can you rewrite this to use nixos 25.05

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = "x86_64-linux"; }; # Replace with your system
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = [
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.override {
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        })
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src



#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13 on NixOS 25.05";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = "x86_64-linux"; }; # Replace with your system
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = [
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.override {
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        })
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

The only change is ==nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";==. This pins your flake to the package set corresponding to NixOS 25.05.  Your builds will be more stable.

*** to build and run the flake.nix i should do the following

#+begin_src sh
nix flake update
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
nix develop
#+end_src


Yes, those are the standard commands:

1.  =nix flake update=:  Updates the flake's inputs (nixpkgs in this case) to the latest commit on the specified branch (=nixos-25.05= in your flake).  You run this to pick up changes to the packages.

2.  =nix develop=: Enters the development shell defined in your =flake.nix=.  This sets up your environment with the specified =buildInputs= (openai-whisper, CUDA, etc.).  From within this shell, you can run your Python scripts that use openai-whisper with CUDA.


*** i get this error with the flake.nix

#+begin_example
nix develop
error: flake 'path:/home/djwilcox/nix/whisper' does not provide attribute 'devShells.x86_64-linux.default', 'devShell.x86_64-linux', 'packages.x86_64-linux.default' or 'defaultPackage.x86_64-linux'
       Did you mean devShells?
#+end_example


The error message indicates that your flake doesn't define a =devShells.x86\_64-linux.default= attribute. This is because your =outputs= function creates a =devShells.default=, but not a =devShells.x86\_64-linux.default=.

Nix is trying to be explicit about the system architecture. Here's how to fix it:

*Option 1:  Explicit System Support (Recommended for Clarity)*

Modify the =outputs= function to explicitly create a =devShells= attribute for your system.

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13 on NixOS 25.05";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux"; # Define the system
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = system; };
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell { # Explicitly define for the system
      buildInputs = [
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.override {
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        })
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

Key changes:

1.  =system = "x86_64-linux";`:  We explicitly define the system architecture as a variable.  This makes the flake more readable and easier to adapt to other systems.
2.  `devShells.${system}.default = ...`: We use string interpolation to create the attribute name dynamically.  This creates the `devShells.x86_64-linux.default` attribute that Nix expects.
3. `pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = system; };` Pass `system` to `import nixpkgs`.

**Option 2:  Default Attribute (Less Explicit)**

You can also make your existing `devShells.default` apply to all systems by renaming it.

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13 on NixOS 25.05";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = "x86_64-linux"; }; # Replace with your system
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShell.x86_64-linux = pkgs.mkShell { # Changed to devShell.x86_64-linux
      buildInputs = [
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.override {
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        })
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

Choose *one* of these options. Option 1 is generally preferred because it's more explicit. After making the change, try `nix develop` again. It should now work.  If you *still* get an error, double-check that your system architecture (=x86\_64-linux=) is correct. Also check if you have a =nix.conf= file overriding the default system.

*** the flake.nix needs the non free option

       a) To temporarily allow unfree packages, you can use an environment variable
          for a single invocation of the nix tools.

            $ export NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1

          Note: When using `nix shell`, `nix build`, `nix develop`, etc with a flake,
                then pass `--impure` in order to allow use of environment variables.

       b) For `nixos-rebuild` you can set
         { nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true; }
       in configuration.nix to override this.

       Alternatively you can configure a predicate to allow specific packages:
         { nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate = pkg: builtins.elem (lib.getName pkg) [
             "torch"
           ];
         }

       c) For `nix-env`, `nix-build`, `nix-shell` or any other Nix command you can add
         { allowUnfree = true; }
       to ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix.
#+end_example


Okay, the error indicates that the =torch= package has an unfree license, and Nix is refusing to build it. There are several ways to solve this. I recommend adding =allowUnfree = true;= to your flake.

Here's the updated =flake.nix=:

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13 on NixOS 25.05";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = system;
      config.allowUnfree = true; # Add this line
    };
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = [
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.override {
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        })
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

The key change is adding =config.allowUnfree = true;` inside the `import nixpkgs` call. This tells Nix to allow packages with unfree licenses within this flake's environment.

After making this change, run `nix develop` again.  It should now build the `torch` package and enter the development shell.

       error: future-1.0.0 not supported for interpreter python3.13
#+end_example


Okay, the error "future-1.0.0 not supported for interpreter python3.13" indicates a problem with the dependencies of =openai-whisper=.  The =future= package, version 1.0.0, is not compatible with Python 3.13.

Here's how to fix it:

1.  *Override =future=:*  The best approach is to override the =future= dependency to a compatible version. Since =python313Packages.future= will also likely be 1.0.0, let's try excluding it and seeing if a newer version gets pulled in transitively.  If not, we'll need to specify a specific, working version.

Here's the updated =flake.nix=:

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13 on NixOS 25.05";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = system;
      config.allowUnfree = true;
    };
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = [
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: rec {
          propagatedBuildInputs = builtins.filter (dep: dep.name != "future") oldAttrs.propagatedBuildInputs;
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        }))
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

Explanation:

-   =openai-whisper.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: ...)=: This allows us to modify the attributes of the =openai-whisper= package.
-   =propagatedBuildInputs = builtins.filter (dep: dep.name != "future") oldAttrs.propagatedBuildInputs;=: This filters out the =future= package from the list of propagated build inputs. This forces nix to find another =future= dependency, hopefully a working one.
-   =triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;= and the =torch= override: these are still needed for CUDA support.

After making this change, run =nix flake update= and then =nix develop= again.

If you STILL get the same =future= error, then the =future= dependency is being brought in transitively.  In that case, you would need to explicitly add a working version of =future= as a =buildInput= /before/ =openai-whisper=.  First find the correct version, then:

#+begin_src nix
buildInputs = [
  pythonPackages.future_4_x_x  # Replace with the correct package name and version
  (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: rec {
      propagatedBuildInputs = builtins.filter (dep: dep.name != "future") oldAttrs.propagatedBuildInputs;
      triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
      torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
        triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
      };
    }))
  pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
];
#+end_src

This ensures that the correct version of =future= is available /before/ =openai-whisper= is built, and the =future= that's incompatible is filtered out.

Let me know if the first solution (filtering out =future=) works!  If not, we'll investigate adding a compatible version explicitly.

there is this package

python313Packages.future
Clean single-source support for Python 3 and 2

[[https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=25.05&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=future]]

python-future is the missing compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python 3. It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible codebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead.

It provides future and past packages with backports and forward ports of features from Python 3 and 2. It also comes with futurize and pasteurize, customized 2to3-based scripts that helps you to convert either Py2 or Py3 code easily to support both Python 2 and 3 in a single clean Py3-style codebase, module by module.

python313Packages.future


Okay, since filtering =future= didn't work, we'll try explicitly adding it.  We'll use =python313Packages.future=, but we'll also override =openai-whisper= to /remove/ its original, broken =future= dependency.  This is crucial to ensure the correct version is used.

Here's the updated =flake.nix=:

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13 on NixOS 25.05";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = system;
      config.allowUnfree = true;
    };
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = [
        pythonPackages.future,  # Add the correct 'future' package
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: rec {
          propagatedBuildInputs = builtins.filter (dep: dep.name != "future") oldAttrs.propagatedBuildInputs;
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        }))
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

Key changes:

-   =pythonPackages.future,=:  We add =pythonPackages.future= to the =buildInputs=. This makes the compatible =future= available in the environment.
-   The =openai-whisper= override:  It still filters out the original =future= dependency to prevent conflicts.

After making this change, run =nix flake update= and then =nix develop= again.  This should now install the correct version of =future= and allow =openai-whisper= to build successfully.

If this STILL fails, the issue might be deeper.  Could you please run =nix develop --show-trace= and paste the /full/ output?  The full trace will give more insight into where the dependency resolution is going wrong.  Also, double check that you haven't set conflicting environment variables that might be affecting the Python environment.

You are absolutely correct!  That's a classic mistake. Trailing commas are not allowed in Nix lists.

Here's the corrected code (removed the trailing comma after =pythonPackages.future=):

#+begin_src nix

    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = system;
      config.allowUnfree = true;
    };
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in

Remove the comma after =pythonPackages.future=, then run =nix flake update= and =nix develop= again.  Apologies for the error in the previous response!

       error: future-1.0.0 not supported for interpreter python3.13
#+end_example


The trace, while not incredibly detailed, confirms the problem is still with =future-1.0.0= and Python 3.13. The critical line is:

=error: future-1.0.0 not supported for interpreter python3.13=

Given that we've tried explicitly including and excluding =future=, the issue is likely occurring /within/ the build process of =openai-whisper= itself.  Even though we're providing a =future= package, the build script for =openai-whisper= might be ignoring our environment and trying to install its own, incompatible version.

Here's a more aggressive approach using =pythonRemoveDependencies=:

#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "openai-whisper with CUDA using Python 3.13 on NixOS 25.05";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = system;
      config.allowUnfree = true;
    };
    pythonPackages = pkgs.python313Packages;
  in
  {
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = [
        pythonPackages.future,
        (pythonPackages.openai-whisper.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: rec {
          propagatedBuildInputs = builtins.filter (dep: dep.name != "future") oldAttrs.propagatedBuildInputs;
          # Use pythonRemoveDependencies to forcibly remove future
          pythonRemoveDependencies = [ "future" ]; # Force remove
          triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          torch = pythonPackages.pytorch-bin.override {
            triton = pythonPackages.triton-cuda;
          };
        }))
        pkgs.cudaPackages.cudatoolkit
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

The crucial addition is:

=pythonRemoveDependencies = [ "future" ];=

This option is specifically designed to remove dependencies during the Python build process, regardless of what the build script tries to do.  It's a more forceful way of ensuring that the incompatible =future= package is not installed. We are also explicitly including =pythonPackages.future= to ensure a good one is used.

Run =nix flake update= and =nix develop= again. If this /still/ fails, then the problem is extremely deep and likely a bug in the Nix package definition for =openai-whisper=. In that case, I would recommend reporting the issue on the Nixpkgs GitHub repository. Provide them with the complete trace and your =flake.nix= file. This will allow Nixpkgs maintainers to investigate and fix the issue.

Let me know if this more aggressive approach works. If not, reporting the issue is the next step.

You're right, I apologize for repeatedly making that comma mistake. It's frustrating, and I appreciate you pointing it out.

Since adding =pythonRemoveDependencies= and explicitly including =future= didn't work, and the error persists, the problem is very likely a bug in the nix package definition.

Given the error message and the troubleshooting steps we've taken, I highly recommend reporting this issue on the Nixpkgs GitHub repository. Provide them with the following information:

1.  /Your flake.nix file:/  This allows them to reproduce the issue.
2.  /The complete output of =nix develop --show-trace=./  This gives them the full error trace.
3.  /A clear description of the problem:/ Explain that =future-1.0.0= is not compatible with Python 3.13, and that you've tried various methods to override or remove the dependency without success.
4.  /The whisperx default.nix/

The maintainers of Nixpkgs will be able to investigate the package definition and identify the root cause of the problem. They may need to patch the package to correctly handle the =future= dependency.

I've exhausted my ability to diagnose this issue further without more detailed information about the internal workings of the =openai-whisper= package in Nixpkgs. Reporting the issue is the best course of action at this point.

Once you've reported the issue, please share the link to the GitHub issue here. I'll follow the discussion and try to provide any further assistance if possible.

This further strengthens the case that the problem lies within the Nix package definition of =openai-whisper= itself and isn't specific to flakes. The fact that a simple =shell.nix= produces the same error makes it very likely that the package's build process is ignoring the environment and forcing the installation of the incompatible =future= version.

The next step is definitely reporting this issue to nixpkgs, as the solution is likely a patch to the nix expression. Here are the steps:

1.  Navigate to the Nixpkgs repository on GitHub: =https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs=
2.  Click on "Issues".
3.  Click on "New Issue".
4.  Provide a clear and descriptive title (e.g., "openai-whisper: future-1.0.0 not supported for Python 3.13").
5.  In the issue body, include:
    *   A detailed description of the problem.
    *   The =shell.nix= file that reproduces the issue.
    *   The output of =nix-shell --show-trace shell.nix=.
    *   The =flake.nix= file you were using (if applicable).
    *   Mention that you have tried overriding and removing the =future= dependency without success.
    *   Link to the =default.nix= file for =openai-whisper= in Nixpkgs (=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-25.05/pkgs/development/python-modules/openai-whisper/default.nix=).

By providing all this information, you'll make it easier for the Nixpkgs maintainers to understand and fix the issue. Good luck! Let me know if you would like any assistance with writing the issue.

i cant see anything about futures so i guess its a dependency of one of the packages


You're right, I don't see anything about =future= in the =default.nix= file. This means it's a /transitive dependency/ of one of the listed packages (most likely =torch= or =tiktoken=).

Here's how to approach reporting the issue, given this new information:

-   *Update the Issue Title:* Make it clear that the issue is a transitive dependency. For example: "openai-whisper: Transitive dependency =future-1.0.0= not supported for Python 3.13".
-   *Highlight Transitivity:* In the issue body, emphasize that =future= is /not/ a direct dependency of =openai-whisper=, but rather a transitive dependency. Mention that you've examined the =default.nix= file and it's not explicitly listed.
-   *Suggest Potential Culprits:* Speculate that =torch= or =tiktoken= might be the source of the problematic =future= dependency. This will give the maintainers a starting point for their investigation. They can then examine the dependencies of those packages to pinpoint the exact source of the problem.

Also, since you're using CUDA, it might be worth mentioning in the issue that you've tried overriding =torch= with the CUDA-enabled version (=pytorch-bin.override=), but that didn't resolve the =future= issue. This might provide additional context for the maintainers.
