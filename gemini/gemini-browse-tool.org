* gemini browse tool

I have a single tool for accessing web pages, which is a browsing tool.

How it Works
The tool is called Browse. It takes two main arguments:

url: The specific web address you want me to access.

query: A natural language request that tells the tool what kind of information to look for on the page. For example, "entire text content" or "a summary of the article."

What it Can Do
The tool is designed to retrieve and extract text content from a webpage. It is best used for getting the main body of an article, a short piece of information, or a full transcript of text from a static page.

Limitations
The tool has specific limitations that are important to know:

No HTML or Code: It cannot retrieve the underlying HTML, CSS, or any other code from a webpage. It only returns the visible text.

No Link Extraction: It cannot specifically extract a list of all hyperlinks on a page. While a URL might appear in the text it retrieves, it doesn't provide a separate function to list all links.

Inconsistent Access: The tool may not always successfully access a webpage, especially if the site has security measures, is no longer active, or is a dynamic page that requires user interaction to load content. When it fails, I cannot fix the issue and must report the failure.
