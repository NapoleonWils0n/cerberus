#+STARTUP: content
* Goal

can you read the @video/trump.vtt subtitles file and then create clips for for each sentence that stops with a period using the timestamps using trim-clip script to create the clips from this video @video/trump.mp4

the trim-clip script has these options

#+begin_src sh
trim-clip -s 00:00:00.000 -i input.mp4 -t 00:00:00.000 
#+end_src

the -s option is the start time
the -i option is the file to process
the -t option is the number of seconds after the start time

the -s and -t options accept sexagesimal format including milliseconds
trim-clip automatically create clips with the input name followed by the start time and duration followed by the file extension
so you dont need to specify an output file name

for example to create a 25 second clip starting at 1 minute the command would look like this

#+begin_src sh
trim-clip -s 00:01:00 -i input.mp4 -t 00:00:25
#+end_src

** Context

- File to read: video/trump.vtt
- File to process: video/trump.mp4

** Instructions

1. read the @video/trump.vtt file
   create a list of how many sentence there are which end with a period which is how many clips you need to create

2. process each sentence that ends with a period by getting the start and end timestamps from the srt file

3. take the start time and add it to the -s option of the trim-clip script followed,
   by the -i option and the filw we are processing.

then take the start time and the end time of the sentence and use it with the sexagesimal-time script by passing the start time with the -s option and the end time wth the -e option

like this

#+begin_src sh
sexagesimal-time -s 00:00:02.360 -e 00:00:04.260
#+end_src

this will give you the duration for the clip, for example

#+begin_example
00:00:01.9
#+end_example

take the duration from the sexagesimal-time script
add that to the -t option of the trim-clip script

for example to create a clip with a starting point of

#+begin_example
00:00:02.360
#+end_example

and a duration of

#+begin_example
00:00:01.9
#+end_example

we would use the following trim-clip command

#+begin_src sh
trim-clip -s 00:00:02.360 -i trump.mp4 -t 00:00:01.9
#+end_src
