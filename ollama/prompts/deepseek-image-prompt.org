* Creating text prompts to generate images with Artificial Intelligence

Here is a task i would like you to perform

under the heading "input to process" is a list of fictional characters,
which will be used as text prompts to create images of the characters using artificial intelligence

** Task description
*** Task outline

complete the following tasks in order

1) for each of the characters with an "Index:" text field listed below, based on the "Description" text field 
write additional detailed sentences on their own line for each of the text fields listed in the output format, using the examples provided as well as your training

2) using the output text fields from the first step as a basis for each character write a several hundred word description of the data as a photographic scene. The composition of the scene should have the character as the main focus, so you need to write a detailed description of the charcter including their gender, age, height, build, hair colour, hair style, eye colour, skin tone and facial expression. the scene can either be indoors or outdoors which will 

Notes:

directive you are an artifical intelligence machine that can create images from a text prompt
imagine a scene based on the data
descibe the scene to your self so that you can generate an image from it

go through each of the fictional charcters one by one and ouput a response as described,
each response should be unique to the character

*** Input format

here is an example of the input for one character

#+NAME: input-texfields
#+begin_example
Index: 1
Name: Emma Carter
Occupation: Interior Designer
Description: A 35-year-old woman with shoulder-length brown hair and glasses. She wears a chic, minimalist outfit (black turtleneck, beige trousers) and carries a sketchbook and fabric swatches. She’s standing near a modern furniture installation at Clerkenwell Design Week.
#+end_example

Notes:

if i specify an input text field without a value, i want you to create the value for the text field

for example if i specify "Outdoor lighting:" without a value,
i want you to generate the value based on the examples i have given you

#+NAME: input-texfields
#+begin_example
Outdoor lighting:
#+end_example

However if i specify an input text field with a value,
i want you to use the value for the text field from the example i have provided

#+NAME: input-texfields
#+begin_example
Outdoor lighting: Dawn
#+end_example

*** Output format

the output is comprissed of two parts

1) output-texfields
2) image-prompt

output the reponse in the following format,
each line should not have any extra characters added before the text field in the response

this is a list of all the text fields for the character in the output format,
including the items found in the input format

Here’s a list of common indoor lighting conditions found in photographs, along with brief descriptions:

#+begin_example
1. Flood Lighting - Bright, directional illumination that spreads light evenly over a large area, often used for dramatic effects or highlighting specific surfaces.

2. Task Lighting - Evenly illuminates specific working areas, such as desks, workstations, or art displays, providing the necessary light for tasks.

3. Natural Light - Allows in-door sunlight to filter through windows, creating a warm, soft glow and adding natural warmth to spaces.

4. Overhead Lighting - Standard fixtures like fluorescent or LED lamps suspended from the ceiling that provide consistent illumination without shadows.

5. Spotlights - Focused beams of light ideal for highlighting specific areas, such as in art galleries or design studios for dramatic effect.

6. Under-Cabinet Lighting - Small, recessed lights mounted below cabinetry to highlight decorative elements while avoiding direct workspace glare.

7. Recessed Fixtures - Sleek, indirect lighting sources like fluorescent or LED strips that create a uniform glow in living spaces and provide aesthetics without harsh shadows.

8. Wall Sconces - Large, decorative lamps mounted on walls that evenly illuminate surfaces like bookshelves, tables, or decorative panels.

9. Emergency Lighting - Intended for safety, these small, directional lights are often used to highlight specific areas in a space for visual emphasis.

10. Accent Lights - Small, decorative or task-specific lights added for aesthetic purposes without affecting the overall lighting balance of a room.

   - Brightest part of the day, direct sunlight fills open spaces. Can get shaded at midday depending on location.

5. Afternoon ( Late Morning)
   - Sunlight is consistent and warm with longer shadows as the sun starts to set.

6. Evening ( Early Evening)
   - Sunlight becomes cooler as the sun sets, casting long shadows. The sky often turns deep orange or pink.

2. Low Angle: Shots from below eye level, making subjects look down, adding drama.

3. High Angle: Shots from above eye level, making subjects look up.

4. Wide Shot: Captures a broad field of view, encompassing more space.

5. Panoramic View: A wide shot spanning 180 degrees horizontally.

6. Curvilinear Perspective: Diagonal tilt creates effects like converging train tracks.

7. Perspective Distortion: Proportions altered to enhance stretching or compression.

8. Over-the-Shoulder Shot: Used in portrait work for an extra element without moving the subject.

9. Wide Eye Shot: Uses distortion to create artistic emphasis on a subject.

10. Tilted Angle (Left/Right): Camera tilts left or right from the subject line, creating directional interest.

11. Diamonds & Bubbles: Diagonal lines draw attention to specific objects.

12. Averted Gaze: Camera faces the background, suggesting the subject is looking away.

13. Open View: A wide shot focusing on detail without a particular subject point.

14. Aerial Shot: High above ground for bird's eye views, possibly using tilt instead of height.

15. Extreme Wide Angle: Expands field width with distortion, adding visual impact.
