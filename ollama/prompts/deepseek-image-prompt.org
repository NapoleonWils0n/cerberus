* create an image description for each of the characters

based on their names, occupations, and descriptions,
write a detailed description of the scene including the description with lighting and camera angles.

you goal is to write a detailed description for each character as a photographic scene that can be used by dalle 3 artifical intelligence machine that can create images from a text prompt.

For each, think about the setting where they're located because that affects the lighting and composition.

Now, for each person, I need to integrate these elements into a coherent image description that highlights their roles, the setting, and the atmosphere without making it too cluttered.

1. you should decide if the location is indoors in which case you should write a description which includes "Indoor lighting:",
   or if its outdoors in which case you should write a description which includes "Outdoor lighting:"

2. The composition of the scene should have the character as the main focus, so you need to write a detailed description of the
   charcter including their gender, age, height, build, hair colour, hair style, eye colour, skin tone and facial expression.
   
3. if its not specified in the description if the scene is indoors or outdoor, you choose and then describe the lighting condition
   using the examples from "Indoor lighting:" or "Outdoor lighting:"

4. go through each of the fictional charcters one by one and ouput a response as described,
   each response should be unique to the character

5. important each character should be in their own scene without any of the other characters

Okay, so I need to create detailed image descriptions for each of these fictional characters based on their names, occupations, and descriptions, followed by a coherent scene description with lighting and camera angles.

First, I should go through each index one by one.

For each character, I need to extract relevant details like age, gender, hair color, clothing style, accessories, and setting.

Then, determine if the location is indoors or outdoors, as that affects lighting and composition and include a detailed description of the lighting and camera angles.

list the characters and then process them
the response for each character be no more 160 words long
