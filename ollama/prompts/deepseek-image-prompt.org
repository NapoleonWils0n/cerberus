5. Spotlights - Focused beams of light ideal for highlighting specific areas, such as in art galleries or design studios for dramatic effect.

6. Under-Cabinet Lighting - Small, recessed lights mounted below cabinetry to highlight decorative elements while avoiding direct workspace glare.

7. Recessed Fixtures - Sleek, indirect lighting sources like fluorescent or LED strips that create a uniform glow in living spaces and provide aesthetics without harsh shadows.

8. Wall Sconces - Large, decorative lamps mounted on walls that evenly illuminate surfaces like bookshelves, tables, or decorative panels.

9. Emergency Lighting - Intended for safety, these small, directional lights are often used to highlight specific areas in a space for visual emphasis.
