Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to prepend a specific URL to each line of text containing latitude and longitude coordinates. Let's break this down.

First, the URL they provided is https://www.google.com/maps/@?api=1&map_action=pano&viewpoint=. I notice that it uses placeholders for the viewpoint parameters, which are exactly what the coordinates provideâ€”latitude and longitude. So, each line of the input text has these two numbers, which should replace the viewpoint part.

Looking at the input, there's a block of properties with some lines containing coordinates separated by commas. My job is to take each coordinate pair, remove any existing viewpoint parameters (if present), and add the URL before each pair.

Wait, but in this case, all the lines are just plain numbers without any other text, so I don't have to worry about existing viewpoints. It's straightforward: prepend the URL to each line as is.

I also need to make sure that I don't modify the URL or the input text at all. The output should be each coordinate line prefixed with the URL, and each result on a new line without any additional text or encoding.

Hmm, so for example, taking the first coordinate "51.532490,-0.111180", I just need to add the URL before it, making sure there's no space between the URL and the first digit of the latitude.

I should also ensure that each modified line is on its own new line without any extra spaces or formatting. Since the user doesn't want a script or extra code, just plain text with each coordinate line prefixed correctly.

Alright, so I'll go through each line in the input and prepend the URL to it, ensuring each one ends up on a separate line as required.
