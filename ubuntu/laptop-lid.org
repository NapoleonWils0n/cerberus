#+STARTUP: showall hideblocks
* laptop lid

If you look into the content of the file /etc/systemd/logind.conf, you’ll see three different types of default settings for the laptop lid closing.

#+begin_example
HandleLidSwitch: When the laptop is on battery power
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower: When the laptop is plugged into a power outlet
HandleLidSwitchDocked: When the laptop is connected to a docking station
#+end_example

If you want, you can change the value of those parameters to one of these as per your preference:

#+begin_example
lock: lock when lid is closed
ignore: do nothing
poweroff: shutdown
hibernate: hibernate when lid is closed 
#+end_example

I would suggest going with ignore if you don’t want your system do anything special when the laptop lid is closed.

You can either edit the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file and uncomment the said settings and change their value, or you create a new file in /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d directory. Create this directory if it doesn’t exist.
