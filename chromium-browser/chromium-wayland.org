search for wayland and change ozone-platform-hint to auto

#+begin_example
ozone-platform-hint auto
#+end_example

Note: When changing the "ozone-platform-hint" in browser flags menu, the browser will provide you a relaunch button. Do not use it, because the browser will still be relaunched in a platform it was before changing the flag. You need to close the browser, then open it.
