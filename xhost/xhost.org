To provide access to an application running with sudo or su to the graphical server (aka your X session aka your computer screen), open a terminal and type as your normal user: 

#+begin_src sh
xhost +SI:localuser:"$(whoami)"
#+end_src

To get things back to normal, with controlled access to the X screen:

#+begin_src sh
xhost -
#+end_src
